#JWT stands for Jason Web Token

client											Server
 											(has secretKey)

First Request for Auth::
-----------username+password---->            Generate JWT if username and passwd ok.
           
<--------- <-------sends back JWT token to client as response -----------------------


Second/Subsequent Request with JWT token as Header
Header:JWT+ Payload ----------------sent to Server-------server validates using secret key.
SUCCES response     <---if ok then resturn reponse<------------------------------  


Structure of JWT(header.payload.signature)::
JWT consists of three parts:

1)header
2)payload
3)signature

NOTE::All three are encoded using Base 64 encoding.(Not safe)

Structure of Header

Header{
type:JWT       //it will be JWT always
algo:RS512       //Hasing algorith to be used
}


Structure of Payload is simple the actual data taht need to be transfered to Server from Client.

Payload
{
"user":"anoop"
"role":"admin"
}

signature::

var str=base64(header)+base64(payload)

var sign=hashAlgorithmRS512(str,secretKey)


How tokens are validated in case someone has tampered token inflight.
Ans:: Actually token when sent to server always create signature using header+payload and
 this signature is matched whether it exists in server of not.
