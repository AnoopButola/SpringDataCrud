1)InitializingBean,DisposableBean are lifecycleinterfaces and any bean initiated by Spring container can be modified at different states.
2)Spring provides above 2 interfaces for those purpose.
3)So Any Bean can implement these interfaces and override given method
4)Lifecycle methods flow is 
     
 From spring sequence of Lifecycle methods is ::
 1)Methods annotated with @PostConstruct
 2)afterPropertiesSet() as defined by the InitializingBean callback interface
 3)A custom configured init() method

Destroy methods are called in the same order:
  1)Methods annotated with @PreDestroy
  2)destroy() as defined by the DisposableBean callback interface
  3)A custom configured destroy() method
     
 NOTE::::destroy and cleanup almost same(called  when container destroys bean) and destroy usage is discouraged as it couples code to spring.
