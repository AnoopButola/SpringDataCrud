#BASIC Docker image creation steps.

1)Create Docker file which specifies what all need to be packaged.
2)Pass this docker file as an input while creating docker image.
 docker image build -t webimage


####
In my case I require 2 container one for web and another for sql and both will be communication over network.
This network is just like LAN on which different container can interact with each other.
Now this network can be created by following approaches:
  a)CLI commands  can  be used which is kinda manual  step.
  b)Second is docker-compose. Docker-compose is utility which is driven by yml file.This approach is more 
    dynamic and preferred.


##WorkFlow  
1)Use 2 images , one for web and one for db
2)web one is my own image.
3)sql one can be directly pulled from docker hub.
4)Introduce docker compose yml file which will help in inter communicating docker container.
                  or 
  Can achieve same using CLI manual commands as mentioned below.
  
  
$ docker network create web-sql

HP@HP-PC MINGW64 ~/Build-Folder-Anoop
$ docker network ls
NETWORK ID          NAME                DRIVER              SCOPE
7dfcf07f6844        bridge              bridge              local
70a5c088ace3        host                host                local
56c99d1fa238        none                null                local
d7ffafd9b0c4        web-sql             bridge              local


I will use the image provided by dockerhub to run as container. 
Also we will specify following when running the container
a. name of the mysql container 
a. What should be the password for MYSQL
b. We want to create the Database named db_example.
c. specify the network web-sql on which this container should be created.
d. start the container in detached mode.

docker container run --name mysqldb --network web-sql -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=root -e MYSQL_DATABASE=db_example -d mysql


 
HP@HP-PC MINGW64 ~/Build-Folder-Anoop
$ docker exec  -it mysqldb mysql -uroot -p
the input device is not a TTY.  If you are using mintty, try prefixing the command with 'winpty'

HP@HP-PC MINGW64 ~/Build-Folder-Anoop
$ mintty docker exec  -it mysqldb mysql -uroot -p

HP@HP-PC MINGW64 ~/Build-Folder-Anoop
$ winpty docker exec  -it mysqldb mysql -uroot -p
Enter password:
